    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      &emsp;I am a professional in the Information Systems field. I am currently an instructor at Tooele Technical College in Tooele, UT. 
      I started off my carrer in Information Systems in 1991 as a computer technician for the Navy. 
      <br> &emsp;Over the subsequent years I have worked for many businesses both large and small primarily doing Computer Systems Administration, Help Desk work, Network Administration, and Mobile Device Management. 
      <br>
      &emsp;During the COVID Pandemic I decided to go back to school to update my programming skills at Tooele Technical College.  I have really enjoyed getting back into the software development field. <br>
      &emsp;I really enjoy my current possition as an instructor, being able to help students progress and learn. I also enjoy being able to expand my knowledge and skills in programming as well.
