    <h1>Education Details</h1>
    <p>I have attended several colleges, because of the nature of the work I did for the Navy I didn't have time to 
        attend steadily until I got out of the Navy.
        I graduated from Stevens-Henager College with a Bachelors Degree in computer Science.
        I attended Tooele Technical College as a way to update my outdated skills in web development and programming. 
        I did this with the intention of moving out of the Computer Administration jobs into Software Development jobs.
