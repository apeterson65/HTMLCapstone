    <h1>Skills Details</h1>
    <p>Here are some additional details on my skills</p>
    <h2>Hardware Administration</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Computer Administration
        <p>
            20 years experience with the military in computer administration.
            I spent several years in call centers doing remote computer troubleshooting
            and administration.  Examples would be, setting up network printers, making
            changes to active directory, connecting network shares, etc...
        </p>
        
      </li>
      <li>Network Administration
        <p>While in the military I learned about and became proficient in network management and troubleshooting. 
            I would maintain not only local area connections but also would work on wide area connections, typically making
            changes on the Cisco Routers as needed. 
            As a civilian I worked heavily in network admistration at most of the companies I worked for. 
            At Dollar Financial Group I went from a computer technician to Telecom Administrator managing connections
            for over 350 retail locations. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Mobile Device Management
        <p>Starting at Dollar Financial Group and moving into my time with Accenture I was heavily involved 
            with setting up and troubleshooting mobile devices. I used several platforms to manage the phones
            most MDM software have very similar features and interfaces. 
            With the Mobile Devices it was critial to ensure lines were disconnected when employees left.
            Resolving billing issues at both companies ended up saving them over $100,000 per year in expenses 
            for lines not longer in use. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>VOIP Phone Systems
        <p>At Dollar Financial Group, as I moved into Telecom Administration I used a company
            specific phone system to set up VOIP lines, and worked with the Telco to provided
            the appropriate POP for the lines and convert the existing numbers to the company 
            VOIP pool.  
            At Accenture I used the Cisco Call Manager to manage VOIP lines throughout 
            the clients sites.
